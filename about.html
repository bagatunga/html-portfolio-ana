<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Ana, a web developer enthusiast with a passion for videogames. Working in hospitality for the moment but trying to learn new skills and become a web developer.
<p>I'm from Toledo, Spain making Spanish my native language. Having spent numerous years in Ireland, English has become a strong second language for me. I'm currently working on getting even better at English through some ongoing studies!
<p>When I'm not immersed in work, you'll find me playing some videogames, listening to music or learning new coding skills. I believe in keeping things fun and dynamic, both in and out of the workplace.</p>
